Here is a short description of the plugin.  This should be no more than 150 characters.  No markup here.
This plugin enables individual author descriptions for each single blog in a multisite network.

== Description ==

When running [WordPress Multisites](http://codex.wordpress.org/Create_A_Network) to maintain various top level domains or a multilingual version of your site you might probably run into the problem of having the same author description / biography on each of them.

This is unfortunate not only on multilingual sites.

Long story short, this plugin displays the author biography for each user on a per blog basis.

You don’t have to do anything, but to install and activate the plugin to it’s simple, but useful feature.

Please visit the github repository on https://github.com/webzunft/multisite-individual-author if you want to contribute, post a specific feature request or bug report.

== Other Notes ==

Some things you might want to know:
* the plugin only works when multisite support is enabled, but wouldn’t harm a normal blog when activated (is just not doing anything there)
